# Product Purchase Calculator

This program calculates the total value of a product purchase based on user inputs for the product name, price, and quantity. It applies a discount if the product name is 'SPECIAL' or the total exceeds 10,000.

## How to Use

1. Open the program in a JavaScript environment.
2. Enter the product name.
3. Enter the product price.
4. Enter the quantity of the product.
5. If the product name is 'SPECIAL' or the total exceeds 10,000, you will be prompted to enter the discount percentage.
6. The program will calculate the total value of the purchase, with or without the discount, and display it.

Note: The program validates the inputs to ensure they are valid numbers before proceeding with the calculations. If an invalid input is entered, an error message will be displayed, and the user will be prompted again.

Feel free to modify the code according to your specific needs.
